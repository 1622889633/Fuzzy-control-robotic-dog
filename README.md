Title: Fuzzy-control-robotic-dog

Introduction:
The project aims to enhance the adaptability and robustness of robotic dogs by employing fuzzy algorithms, specifically focusing on the Freenove Robotic Dog Kit, which is based on the Raspberry Pi 4B platform. The goal is to create an advanced navigation system through centralized scheduling achieved by the cooperation between higher-level commands and lower-level machine operations. This would allow the robotic dog to efficiently execute action commands, navigate complex paths, and adapt to its environment with improved responsiveness.
To accomplish these objectives, the project will develop a path planning system that integrates sensory inputs like ultrasonic sensors and machine vision, enabling precise movement in dynamic settings. A fuzzy logic-based closed-loop control system will be designed to refine the robot's movements, allowing it to perform complex commands and interact with its surroundings more naturally. Additionally, the project involves seamless hardware and software integration to ensure energy efficiency, real-time processing, and the robust performance of control commands.

User Installation Instructions
To set up the software for the Freenove Robotic Dog project using a Raspberry Pi, you will need to follow these step-by-step instructions, assuming you are starting from scratch:

Preparing the Raspberry Pi:

Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS image from the official website.
Use the Raspberry Pi Imager to write the image file to an SD card.
Insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi, connect the Raspberry Pi to power and peripherals, and boot up the system.
Configure the Raspberry Pi to enable VNC service for remote desktop access through the Raspberry Pi configuration settings.
Setting Up the Development Environment:

Ensure Python3 and PyQt5 are installed on the Raspberry Pi for server and client development.
Start the server application on the Raspberry Pi, which initializes the TCP server and listens for client connection requests.
Upon receiving a connection request, establish a connection and start a session to await commands from the client.
Installing Dependencies and Libraries:

Install all necessary management tools and dependencies required for the project.
Install libraries related to sensor GPIO, Picamera, drivers, and communication essential for controlling the robotic dog.
Using Freenove Client Software:

Use the Freenove Client for Smart Dog software to calibrate the quadruped robot, ensuring the center of gravity is maintained for balanced gait.
Utilize the Freenove app to test and execute commands such as movement, video streaming, LED control, and ultrasonic distance measurement.
